# Keystroke Analysis

## Overview

Keystroke Analysis is the process of examining the typing patterns of individuals to extract meaningful information, often used for authentication, behavioral analysis, and anomaly detection. This project collects and analyzes user keystroke data to study typing behavior and generate insights.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Captures key press, key release times, and calculates dwell time (duration of key press).
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identifies unique patterns in users' typing habits.
- **Authentication**: Uses keystroke dynamics for identity verification.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects irregular typing behaviors that could indicate suspicious activity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library for capturing keystrokes
- `numpy`, `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for visualizing the data
- `scikit-learn` for classification and anomaly detection

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pynput numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## Setup

## Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepthiiii4/keystroke-analysis.git
cd keystroke-analysis
```
